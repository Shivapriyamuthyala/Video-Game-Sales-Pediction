# 🎮 Video Game Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Introduction

Video game sales prediction is an important task in the gaming industry, helping developers, publishers, and retailers make informed decisions. The objective of this project is to predict video game sales using machine learning models trained on historical sales data. By leveraging various classification and regression algorithms, we aim to enhance the accuracy of sales forecasts.

## 🎯 Aim

To develop a machine learning-based sales prediction system that forecasts video game sales based on various attributes such as genre, platform, and publisher.

## ❓ Problem Statement

📊 The gaming industry is highly competitive, and predicting game sales accurately is crucial for business success. Traditional forecasting methods are often inaccurate due to evolving market trends. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy and provide data-driven insights.

## 🔍 Existing System
